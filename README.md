vimstuffs
=========

A collection of files used to get vim going on any computer. Mainly for myself, but feel free to clone

For Mac/Linux
--------------
- Copy **.vim** folder, **.vimrc**, and **.gvimrc** into home directory (~/username)

For Windows
-----------
- Copy **win/vim/vimfiles** folder, **win/_gvimrc**, and **win/_vimrc** into home folder (C:\Users\username)
- If using VsVim, copy **win/_vsvimrc** into home directory
